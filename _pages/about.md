### About me
I am Amirmohammad, a medical student fascinated by the mind-bending complexity of life and its ultimate masterpiece: **intelligence**. With my background in biology and machine learning, I’m on an exciting journey to explore how intelligence, whether it’s born from nature or crafted by humans, emerges, adapts, and evolves. Think about the cooperation of your eyes, neural pathways, and the supercomputer in your head as you read this line. Isn’t that amazing? I’m inspired by how life finds clever ways to adapt and improve.
