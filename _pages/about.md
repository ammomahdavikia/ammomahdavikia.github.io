# About me
I am a medical student fascinated by the mind-bending complexity of life and its ultimate masterpiece: intelligence. With my background in biology and machine learning, I’m on an exciting journey to explore how intelligence, whether it’s born from nature or crafted by humans, emerges, adapts, and evolves. I’m inspired by how life finds clever ways to adapt and improve. I am interested in a diverse topics of research and I am currently working on vision language models and applications of ML in healthcare industry.
